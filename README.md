# AI-Powered MMSE Application

## Introduction

The AI-Powered MMSE Application is a cutting-edge web-based tool that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the
traditional Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). It offers healthcare providers an efficient and accurate way to assess
cognitive health through real-time AI analysis.

## Key Features

- **AI-Enhanced Cognitive Assessment**: Conducts MMSE tests with integrated AI-driven analysis.
- **User Management**: Handles secure management of patient profiles, test results, and sessions.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Supports dynamic question rendering and real-time response evaluation.
- **Data Security**: Implements robust encryption and role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive data.
- **Responsive User Interface**: Developed with Vue.js to provide a smooth experience across devices.

## Technical Stack

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

![System Architecture](./screenshots/architecture.svg)

The architecture includes:

- **Vue.js frontend**: Manages user interactions and UI components.
- **Spring Boot backend**: Handles business logic, data processing, and AI operations.
- **PostgreSQL database**: Manages patient data and MMSE results.
- **Redis cache**: Improves performance by storing frequently accessed data.
- **MinIO storage**: Manages media files securely.

### Prerequisites

- **Java v17**
- **Node.js v18.16.1**
- **npm v9.8.0**
- **Docker v25.0.2**
- **Docker Compose v2.24.3**
- **Ollama**: Required to run the AI model (`ollama run llama3.1:70b`)
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for GPT-4 integration

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and configured.
2. **Start All Containers**: Use the provided script to start all required Docker containers:
   ```bash
   sh start-all-containers.sh
3. Install Frontend Dependencies:
    ```bash
